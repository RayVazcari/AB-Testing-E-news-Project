This project involved performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the E-News Express dataset. The primary goal was to uncover significant insights and patterns within the data, providing a solid foundation for future decision-making processes. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization, employing various Python libraries to achieve these tasks. This experience has further solidified my passion for data science and my ability to draw meaningful conclusions from complex data sets. I look forward to leveraging these insights to drive impactful business solutions. ðŸš€

### ðŸ“Š Project Overview

## Problem Statement <a id="problem-statement"></a>
### Business Context <a id="business-context"></a>

The advent of e-news, or electronic news, portals has offered us a great opportunity to quickly get updates on the day-to-day events occurring globally. The information on these portals is retrieved electronically from online databases, processed using a variety of software, and then transmitted to the users. There are multiple advantages of transmitting news electronically, like faster access to the content and the ability to utilize different technologies such as audio, graphics, video, and other interactive elements that are either not being used or arenâ€™t common yet in traditional newspapers.

E-news Express, an online news portal, aims to expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. With every visitor to the website taking certain actions based on their interest, the company plans to analyze these actions to understand user interests and determine how to drive better engagement. The executives at E-news Express are of the opinion that there has been a decline in new monthly subscribers compared to the past year because the current webpage is not designed well enough in terms of the outline & recommended content to keep customers engaged long enough to make a decision to subscribe.

### Objective <a id="objective"></a>

The design team of the company has researched and created a new landing page that has a new outline & more relevant content shown compared to the old page. In order to test the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers, the Data Science team conducted an experiment by randomly selecting 100 users and dividing them equally into two groups. The existing landing page was served to the first group (control group) and the new landing page to the second group (treatment group). Data regarding the interaction of users in both groups with the two versions of the landing page was collected. Being a data scientist in E-news Express, you have been asked to explore the data and perform a statistical analysis (at a significance level of 5%) to determine the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers for the news portal by answering the following questions:

1. Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?

2. Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?

3. Does the converted status depend on the preferred language? [Hint: Create a contingency table using the pandas.crosstab() function]

4. Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?

### Data Dictionary <a id="data-dictionary"></a>

The data contains information regarding the interaction of users in both groups with the two versions of the landing page.

1. **`user_id`** - Unique user ID of the person visiting the website
2. **`group`** - Whether the user belongs to the first group (control) or the second group (treatment)
3. **`landing_page`** - Whether the landing page is new or old
4. **`time_spent_on_the_page`** - Time (in minutes) spent by the user on the landing page
5. **`converted`** - Whether the user gets converted to a subscriber of the news portal or not
6. **`language_preferred`** - Language chosen by the user to view the landing page

### Summary of Findings

1. **Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?**
   - **T-test Results:**
     - Average time on the new landing page: 6.22 minutes
     - Average time on the old landing page: 4.53 minutes
     - T-test statistic: 5.88
     - P-value: < 0.001
   - **Conclusion:** Users spend significantly more time on the new landing page compared to the old landing page.

2. **Is the conversion rate for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?**
   - **Chi-Square Test Results:**
     - Conversion rate for the new page: Higher
     - Conversion rate for the old page: Lower
     - Chi-square statistic: 5.89
     - P-value: 0.015
   - **Conclusion:** The new landing page has a significantly higher conversion rate compared to the old landing page.

3. **Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?**
   - **Chi-Square Test of Independence Results:**
     - Contingency table analysis
     - Chi-square statistic: 0.85
     - P-value: 0.654
   - **Conclusion:** The conversion status does not significantly depend on the preferred language.

4. **Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?**
   - **ANOVA Test Results:**
     - Average time for English users: 6.5 minutes
     - Average time for Spanish users: 6.2 minutes
     - Average time for French users: 6.0 minutes
     - F-statistic: 0.85
     - P-value: 0.432
   - **Conclusion:** There is no significant difference in the mean time spent on the new landing page across different language groups.

### Business Recommendations

1. **Implement the New Landing Page:**
   - The new landing page should be implemented as the time spent and conversion rate have significantly increased. More users would be engaged after doing so, and most likely this would increase the subscription rate.
   - An increased average time spent on the new landing page indicates that its content or layout is better, making users more engaged.
   - Continue optimizing its layout and content to further increase engagement. Monitor which sections users spend the most time on and refine them to keep the content fresh and engaging.

2. **Monitor User Engagement:**
   - Continue monitoring user engagement metrics, such as time spent and conversion rates, to ensure that the new landing page maintains its effectiveness over time. Regular A/B testing can help make iterative improvements.

3. **Language-Specific Customizations:**
   - Since the conversion status does not depend on the preferred language and the time spent is similar across different languages, there is no immediate need for language-specific customizations.
